who_i_am: My name is Daiwei Lu. I'm a full stack developer. While building UIs, I pay attention to user experiences. I believe the best UIs are not the fancy ones, but those users spend less time on and keep coming back to. I'm also a software engineer. Although it's true that things users touch interests me most, underlying architectures that made everything possible are also fascinating to me. A better architecture ensures engineers spend less time on software and more time on humanity.

what_i_do: When I'm not hacking with web technologies, I develop iOS app. Sometime I also give talks about thing I'm excited with. When I'm offline, I go biking and hangout with friends.
